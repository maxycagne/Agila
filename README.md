# Agila : 36-Hour Hackathon CodeFest Competition - 1st Place

📱 Description
Agila is a mobile application developed by the Cluster 5 representatives of STI College Tarlac for the Tagisan ng Talino 2025: Codefest - National Level. The competition brought together the top developer teams from STI Colleges across the Philippines.

Our team built Agila in 36 hours during an on-site hackathon held at the training lounge of STI College Ortigas-Cainta. Throughout the event, participants were provided with free meals and accommodation in a dormitory located right beside the development lounge. Competitors were required to stay within the venue for the entire duration of the hackathon — creating a fully immersive and collaborative developer experience.

To qualify for the National Level, each team must first secure championships at both the Local Level and Cluster Level competitions. Out of thousands of STI students in the Philippines, only 24 students earn the opportunity to compete in this prestigious annual event and 8 of those students are team captains.

The theme is Dev Time Capsule celebrates a developer's journey by creating a personalized digital snapshot that captures their skills, achievements, and aspirations. It challenges participants to build an interactive project where users can "seal" memories or goals for the future and "open" them later to reflect on their growth. This theme blends storytelling and functionality, encouraging participants to showcase their unique identity as developers while demonstrating creativity and technical expertise.

## 📌 Problem Statement

### 📱 The Challenge: Mobile Transparency for Accountability

The 2025 Philippine national elections have concluded and the country now awaits the official results as vote counting continues. As citizens and institutions anticipate the final outcomes, discussions, around integrity and public trust dominate national discourse.

Corruption slows development, limits access to basic services, and deepends inequality in society. Solving it requires not only institutional will but also empowered and informed citizens. Mobile technology can foster transparency by opening communication channels, simplifying data access, and encouraging civic engagement.

Design and develop a mobile application that supports anti-corruption initiatives through transparency, civic participation, and public accountability. The platform should enable users to report issues, monitor government performance, and access public data in a secure, user-friendly manner.

- **Public Project Monitoring** - updates on local or national government projects.
- **Anonymous Whistleblowing Portal** - for reporting irregularities or unehtical conduct.
- **Open Data Dashboards** - simplified view of public budgets and spending reports.
- **Community Scoreboards** - for rating and providing feedback on public services.

The application must support distinct access roles for Users and Admins, ensuring appropriate permissions and functionality for each.
